            Your borrowing power is a critical number to know because it helps you understand how much you can spend on a property.
            <br /><br />
            Although this calculator will give you an indication as to how much you could borrow, your borrowing capacity between two banks could be thousands of dollars â€“ the difference between purchasing your dream house or settling for your second favourite.
            <br /><br />
            We can work with you to understand which lender is best suited for your situation and get you one step closer to achieving your goals.
